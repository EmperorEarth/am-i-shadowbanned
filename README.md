## What's a shadowban?

When a user is shadowbanned they can continue to make posts and leave
comments without any indication of the ban. However, *everything* they
do is automatically marked as spam. No one will see any of it until
the post or comment is graciously freed by a moderator, if ever. To
the moderator, the post title appears will appear as strikethrough in
addition to the normal red background.

This tool can test whether an account is shadowbanned, normal, or
non-existent. It uses [Any Origin](http://anyorigin.com/) to work
around the cross-domain issue.

## Inspiration

Outside of a post/comment test in a controlled subreddit, I didn't
know how to check for a shadowban until
[StrictScrutiny revealed a nice trick](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1gvr4g/_/caoacis).
